# Overview
This pipeline is modified from NNUnet [1,2] which wins the "Medical Segmentation Decathlon Challenge 2018" and open sourced from https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet.

## Data
The source decathlon datasets can be found from http://medicaldecathlon.com/.

After getting the dataset, please run `create_datalist.py` to get the datalists (please check the command line arguments first). The default seed can help to get the same 5 folds data splits as NNUnet has, and the created datalist will be in `config/`

## Training
Please run `train.py` for training. Please modify the command line arguments according
to the actual situation, such as `determinism_flag` for deterministic training, `amp` for automatic mixed precision.

## Validation
Please run `train.py` and set the argument `mode` to `val` for validation.

## Inference
Please run `inference.py` for inference.

## Examples
There are some examples in `commands/` and train on task 04 (fold 0 for validation):

- `train_task04.sh` is used for training.
- `finetune_task04.sh` is used for finetuning.
- `val_task04.sh` is used for validation.
- `infer_task04.sh` is used for inference.
- If you need to use multiple GPUs, please run scripts that contain `multi_gpu`.
